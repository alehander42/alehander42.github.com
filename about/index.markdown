thoughts on programming

I am interested in language development, everything related to language/editor/ide/ast-based tools, web development and machine learning

I've worked on

* [Pseudo](https://github.com/alehander42/pseudo)

	  A framework for automated code translation, supporting Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript and C#

* [Hermetic](https://github.com/alehander42/hermetic)

	A python-like language with hindley-milner-like type system, which is compiled to C

* [Hivemind](https://github.com/alehander42/hivemind)

  	A prototype of a multi-syntax programming language


* [Elixir](https://github.com/alehander42/bencoder) [torrent](https://github.com/alehander42/tracker_request) [libraries](https://github.com/alehander42/wire)

  	Goal: A modularized Elixir torrent client

and many others:
